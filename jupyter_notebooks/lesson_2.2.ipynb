    "* An ML pipeline is a structured way to go from raw data to a working machine learning model. It ensures that all the necessary steps are followed to train and evaluate the model.\n",

    "### Main steps\n",
    "#### 1. Data collection\n",
    "* Just like gathering ingredients for a recipe, the first step is to collect data.\n",
    "* Data can come from:\n",
    "\t* CSV files\n",
    "\t* Databases\n",
    "\t* APIs\n",
    "\t* Sensors\n",
    "* Example: Collecting customer data from a shopping website.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Data Preprocessing (Cleaning & Formatting)\n",
    "* Raw data is often messy (has missing values, duplicates, errors).\n",
    "* This step cleans the data so the model can learn properly.\n",
    "* Example Steps in Data Preprocessing:\n",
    "\t* Remove missing values or replace them\n",
    "\t* Convert text into numbers (if necessary)\n",
    "\t* Normalize data (scaling numbers to a standard range)\n",
    "* Analogy: Like washing and cutting vegetables before cooking!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model Training\n",
    "* Here, we choose a Machine Learning algorithm and train it on the data.\n",
    "* The model learns patterns from the training data.\n",
    "* Example Algorithms:\n",
    "\t* Decision Trees\n",
    "\t* Linear Regression\n",
    "\t* Neural Networks\n",
    "* Analogy: Like a chef learning a new recipe—practicing until they get it right!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Model Evaluation\n",
    "* We test the model to see how well it performs.\n",
    "* This step ensures the model can make accurate predictions.\n",
    "* Example Metrics:\n",
    "\t* Accuracy\n",
    "\t* Precision & Recall\n",
    "\t* Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "* Analogy: Like tasting the cake to see if it's good or needs improvement!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Deployment & Predictions\n",
    "* If the model works well, we deploy it to make real-world predictions.\n",
    "* Users or applications can now use the trained model.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\t* A model that predicts house prices based on location, size, and number of rooms.\n",
    "\t* A model that recommends movies based on what a user has watched before.\n",
    "* Analogy: Like serving the cake at a party!\n"
